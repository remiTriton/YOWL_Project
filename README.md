# YOWL - Back to School

## Overview of our project.

Welcome everyone, here we are going to introduce you to our project "YOWL".

### YOWL, what is it ?

YOWL is an application web and or / mobile which will let you add comments on all sorts of products related to the Back to School.
YOWL is unique, in fact, it is an app which displays reviews of the most famous giants in the Internet, such as Amazon, Wallmart, and Target.

Here is an example. You are a fresh student, 23 years, and you want to buy furnitures for your studies on the internet. Furthermore, you are exigent, you want the best quality, and you'd like to see customers reviews.

Thanks to YOWL, you'll be able to see reviews from all the giants and quickly compare all kinds of products. If you make a choice, YOWL will directly guide you to the product you want to buy. 

Finally, you'll be able to review directly the products on the app and be part of the YOWL community !

### For who ?

Our target is public between 13 and 35 years old. From the teenager going to High School who wants the best back-pack, to the newparent who wants the best for his children, you'll find in YOWL everything you wants in just one place !



## Functionnalites of the application. 

### Homepage

In the homepage, you'll find a button login if you're already registered, just next to the sign-up button. 
Below, there is a carousel leading directly to one of our categories, all related to the furnitures needed at school.

### Categories

In this page, you'll find directly photos of the product you seek, its price, and its location on the web. You'll be able to quickly switch from Amazon to Wallmart, or to Target. There is also a wrap-menu which will let you travel from categories to categories, and a system of pagination. Each product will be clickable, and this is the next step !

### Products

When you click on a product, a new vue appears. 

This vue will display  : 

- Your name
- Clickable picture which will guide you to the product page.
- Score of the product 
- Some reviews of the product directly fetched from the website
- Reviews of the YOWL community
- A button to add a comment, or respond to another one.
- Also, a like button if you think a comment helped you make your choice or not.
- And, of course, a back button if you'd like to continue your purchases.

In this view, if a comment belongs to you,  you'll be able to update-it or delete it

Also, we'll have the crud of all users and all comments available on our platform.

## How are we going to create the app ?

### Technology Overview

To begin with, we are going to create an API and an AUTH system using Laravel 8, but we will display all the pages thanks to Vue.js, which is really powerful.

We have access to three api, so we're going to fetch them and our own using AXIOS, tool provided by Vue.js.

Something that will be difficult for us is going to be the profile system, and the product view.

### Who are we ?

We are three developpers in formation, and this is one of our final projects.
