# YOWL - Comics / Animes
## Overview of our project.

Welcome everyone, here we are going to introduce you to our project "YOWL".

### YOWL, what is it ?

YOWL is an application web and or / mobile which will let you add comments on all sorts of products related to superheroes and / or animes.
YOWL is unique, in fact, it is an app which displays all animes and heroes in the world, thanks to two public api !

The goal is to build a strong community around those worlds, and, in a later version this year, we'll also add more concepts.
### For who ?

Our target is public between 13 and 35 years old. If you love animes and comics, YOWL is for you, without any ads, it is entirely free !



## Functionnalites of the application. 

### Homepage

In the homepage, you'll find the nav bar with our logo, our logo will always redirect to this page.
Then there are three links, login, register, and product, which let you display the item you want to see thanks to the search bar.

If you're logged in, you'll also see two cruds links and a "kdi" link, which is, in fact, a fake one. Don't forget it's just on beta right now !

Just below there is a picture with one cool image and our slogan, with a citation.

After this you'll see six pictures, three from superheroes.api and three from jikan.api. If you click on an image, you'll go into the details vue.
Fun fact : these images can change if you use the searchbar.

Then you'll see a contact us display for you to reach us directly.

### Admin interface

In the admin interface, we'll have a fake 5 kpi dashboard.
Also we'll have the crud of all users and all comments available on our platform.

## How are we going to create the app ?

### Technology Overview

To begin with, we are going to create an API and an AUTH system using Laravel 8, but we will display all the pages thanks to Vue.js, which is really powerful.

We have access to two apis so we're going to fetch them and our own using old school FETCH method.

### Who are we ?

We are three developpers in formation, and this is one of our final projects.

### Thanks

Many thanks to jikan.api and superheroes.api for their databases which helped us a lot !
